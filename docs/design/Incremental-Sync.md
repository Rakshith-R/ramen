# Incremental Sync for Consistency Groups

Extends [Cephfs-RDR-ConsistencyGroup.md](Cephfs-RDR-ConsistencyGroup.md).

## Summary

When `ramendr.openshift.io/enable-diff: "true"` is set on a DRPolicy
or VRG, Ramen preserves VolumeGroupSnapshots across sync cycles and uses
the [ceph-volsync-plugin](https://github.com/RamenDR/ceph-volsync-plugin)
External mover to transfer only changed blocks between consecutive snapshots.

## Annotation Propagation

```
DRPolicy → VRG → RGS (ReplicationGroupSource)
                → RGD (ReplicationGroupDestination)
```

Checked via `util.IsDiffSyncEnabled()`. Value must be exactly `"true"`.

## VolumeGroupSnapshot Lifecycle

Standard handler: single VGS with fixed name, deleted each cycle.

Diff handler: maintains two VGS via label `ramen.openshift.io/vgs-status`:

| Phase | Action |
|---|---|
| Create | New VGS `{rgs-name}-{timestamp}`, `status=current` |
| Cleanup | Prune old previous, delete restored PVCs, current→previous |

At rest: exactly one VGS with `status=previous` serves as base for next cycle.

```
Cycle N:   [VGS-N: current] → sync → [VGS-N → previous]
Cycle N+1: [VGS-N+1: current] → diff(VGS-N, VGS-N+1) → [VGS-N deleted, VGS-N+1 → previous]
```

## External Spec vs RsyncTLS

Diff sync replaces the standard RsyncTLS ReplicationSource
spec with an External spec:

```go
rs.Spec.External = &ReplicationSourceExternalSpec{
    Provider: "cephfs.csi.ceph.com",
    Parameters: map[string]string{
        "copyMethod":         "Direct",
        "volumeName":         sourcePVCName,
        "baseSnapshotName":   previousSnapshotName,  // from previous VGS
        "targetSnapshotName": currentSnapshotName,    // from current VGS
        "address":            rdService,
        "keySecret":          volsyncPSKSecretName,
    },
}
```

ReplicationDestination similarly uses External with `copyMethod=Snapshot`.

The ceph-volsync-plugin mover compares `baseSnapshotName` and
`targetSnapshotName` at block level using CephFS snapshot diff APIs,
transferring only changed blocks. When `baseSnapshotName` is empty
(first cycle), it falls back to full sync.

## Handler Method Overrides

`diffVolumeGroupSourceHandler` embeds `volumeGroupSourceHandler` and
overrides four methods:

| Method | Standard | Diff |
|---|---|---|
| CreateOrUpdateVGS | Fixed name, single | Timestamp suffix, labels |
| CleanVGS | Delete VGS + PVCs | Preserve previous, rotate |
| RestoreFromVGS | Lookup by name | Lookup by status label |
| CreateOrUpdateRS | RsyncTLS spec | External spec + params |

All other methods inherited: `RestoreVolumesFromSnapshot`,
`CheckReplicationSourceForRestoredPVCsCompleted`, `WaitIfPVCTooNew`,
`EnsureApplicationPVCsMounted`.

## Failover Rollback (CopyMethodDirect)

When `CopyMethodDirect` is used, the RD syncs directly into the app
PVC. On failover the PVC may have partial data from an interrupted
sync and must be rolled back to the last known good snapshot.

Standard path: local RD + local RS with RsyncTLS copy the entire
LatestImage snapshot into the app PVC (full copy).

Diff sync path: replaces the full copy with a block-level diff
rollback using the ceph-volsync-plugin External spec.

### Flow

```
rollbackToLastSnapshot()
  1. Pause main RD
  2. Create current-state snapshot of app PVC
  3. Wait for snapshot ready (return-and-retry)
  4. Create local RD (External, CopyMethodDirect, destPVC=appPVC)
  5. Wait for RD address (plugin populates Status.RsyncTLS.Address)
  6. Create shallow PVC from LatestImage snapshot
  7. Create local RS (External) with diff params
  8. Wait for sync completion
  9. Pause local RD
 10. Cleanup: delete current-state snapshot, shallow PVC, local RS/RD
```

### Local RS External Spec

```go
lrs.Spec.External = &ReplicationSourceExternalSpec{
    Provider: storageClass.Provisioner,
    Parameters: map[string]string{
        "copyMethod":         "Direct",
        "volumeName":         appPVCName,
        "baseSnapshotName":   currentStateSnapshotName,
        "targetSnapshotName": latestImageSnapshotName,
        "address":            localRDServiceAddress,
        "keySecret":          volsyncPSKSecretName,
    },
}
```

The plugin diffs `baseSnapshotName` (current corrupted state) against
`targetSnapshotName` (last known good) and writes only the changed
blocks to `volumeName`, rolling the PVC back efficiently.

## DR Operations

Transparent to failover/relocate. After failover, first sync on the
new primary is full (no previous base); subsequent syncs are incremental.

## Dependencies

* VolumeGroupSnapshot CSI
* ceph-volsync-plugin with External mover support
